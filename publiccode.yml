    shortDescription: push publiccode.yml to your repo
    longDescription: >
      This is a cross-brigade collaborative project among several code for
      america brigades. We are endeavoring to catalogue all the projects that
      all the brigades are working on with the purpose of facilitating further
      cross-brigade collaboration, assisting brigade leadership with tracking
      and marketing their own projects, and helping the mothership Code for
      America organization with same.


      This web application is one piece of our strategy to better index active
      projects. Project maintainers can influence how the indexer "sees" their
      project by putting a descriptive publiccode.yml file in their repository.
      This application enables that by providing a web form that will validate
      and upload a new publiccode.yml file.


      The application comprises a React + Redux application on the frontend
      (bitten completely off Developers Italia) and a single cloud function on
      the backend, for authenticating on GitHub.


      Is this enough characters yet? Nope, I think it needs to be 1000. I really
      need to figure out how the validator works so I can either turn it off or
      modify it.
